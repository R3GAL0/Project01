## Description

Before you can use the app you need to initate a proxy demo (<a href='https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/'>proxy</a>). Visit the website and click on the demo button.

## Usage

The purpose of this web application is to help users find the nearest restaurant or food places closest to them. The user can also specify what type of food they crave, or their budget. Then it displays all the restaurant options. 

## Installation

Our team created a repository in which each of us cloned it into our terminal. We then created a project called "SAM's Restaurant Locator" and added tasks that each of our group had to fulfill. The files for html, javascript and css were created.
